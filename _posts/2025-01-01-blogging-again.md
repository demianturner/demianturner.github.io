description: I've been missing blogging for a few years now. My son is now 8 and hoping to get back into it.

Life has shifted in all the expected and unexpected ways — work, family, the general blur of time — and somewhere along the way, the habit of writing slipped through the cracks. But lately I’ve felt the pull again, and I want to carve out a small, consistent space to reflect, share, and document the things that matter — or simply happen.

Parenting has been wonderful. The early chaos has settled into something more curious and conversational. Some of my son’s questions genuinely stop me in my tracks. It feels like the right time to start writing again.

I’m not sure exactly where this blog will go — maybe a mix of personal notes, tech thoughts, books, projects, and whatever else feels worth capturing. No pressure, just momentum.
