I get this question a lot, so I figured it’s worth a quick blog post.

There’s a clear difference (to me at least!) between checking bin collection info on [Guildford Council's website](https://my.guildford.gov.uk/customers/s/view-bin-collections) versus using the [Which Bin Guilford](https://muse23.com/apps/whichbin/) on iPhone.

This short video shows exactly what I mean:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWzcYTtAO6A"
    style="position: absolute; top:0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>
