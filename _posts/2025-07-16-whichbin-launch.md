description: Which Bin iOS Launch
---

If you’ve ever second-guessed which bins to put out—or found yourself chasing the lorry in slippers—this app is for you.

Which Bin is a simple iPhone app made just for Guildford Borough residents. It tells you exactly which bins to put out, and when — based on your current location and postcode.

## 🧪 Now Available in Public Beta (iPhone Only)

The app is currently available through TestFlight while we test and fine-tune the experience. It’s completely free while in beta, and we’re looking for real-world feedback from local users.

## [Check out the website](https://muse23.com/apps/whichbin/)

## ✅ What it does (for now):

- 	📍 Detects your location to find your bin schedule
- 	♻️ Shows the correct bins for this week and next
- 	🔒 Doesn’t collect personal data — no login, no ads

## 📍 Coverage

So far, Which Bin supports postcodes in:
GU1, GU2, GU3, GU4, GU5, GU7, GU8, GU10, GU12, GU16, GU23, GU24
(more areas may be added later)

## 🚀 How to Join the Beta
- 	If you’re on an iPhone, tap or scan the link below to install via TestFlight
- 	Use it normally and let me know if anything doesn’t look right — especially your schedule
- 	Bonus points if you share it with other Guildford neighbours

## 💬 Why I built this

This started as a personal project to avoid missing collection days. But as I spoke to others around Guildford, it became clear I wasn’t the only one juggling bin calendars.

Now I’m opening it up to local testers to make it better — before launch.

Thanks for trying it out! Questions, feedback, and bug reports all welcome.
