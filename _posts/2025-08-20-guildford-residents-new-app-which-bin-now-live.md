If you live in **Guildford Borough**, there’s a new **free iOS app** that helps you stay on top of your bin collections.  
No more missed days or last-minute scrambles — it shows exactly which bins to put out each week.

- 📍 Works across Guildford Borough (GU1–GU24)  
- 🗑️ Clear icons for refuse, recycling, food, and garden waste  
- 📱 Uses your location to show your schedule instantly  
- 🚫 No ads  

**App Store link:**
